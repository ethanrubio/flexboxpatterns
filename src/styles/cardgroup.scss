      The flex property is a short-hand for 
      setting the flex-shrink, flex-grow,
      and flex-basis properties. These 
      properties control how the element
      resizes to fill its container
      
      We'll also set flex-grow to 1 so 
      that it will expand to fill its
      container (the default value is 1)
      
      We'll set flex-shrink to 1 so that 
      the element will shrink as its
      containers get smaller (the default
      value is 0)
      
      Last we set flex-basis to 0 so that
      its size is solely determined by the
      size of its container (The default 
      value is auto, which would cause 
      the content's size to also be a factor
      in this calculation)
      
      The net result of these properties is 
      that the element is a fluid size and 
      will expand and shrink with its container
      and siblings, but they will all have 
      the same size, even if they have 
      different amounts of content
