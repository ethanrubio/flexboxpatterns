# Flexbox Patterns Practice

This repository contains the SCSS used for the
components at [www.flexboxpatterns.com](http://www.flexboxpatterns.com) used for my own pratice.

## Getting started

Assuming Node is installed, install the project dependencies with
`npm install`. This will install PostCSS and Autoprefixer, which makes things cross-compatible for other browsers.

This project also requires you have [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) installed
(`sudo gem install sass`).

## Commands

`npm run build`

Runs a bash script to compile the necessary files to the dist folder
